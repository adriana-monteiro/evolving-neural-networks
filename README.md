# Evolving Neural Networks: A Neuroevolution project

This is a small project developed as a deliverable for the Neuroevolution course of the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS. The purpose was to build the first stepping stones for a ["DENSER-like"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10710-018-9339-y) framework.

## Key Project Components
1. Defining a string-based representation for the networks (the genotype);
2. Defining a network class that is able to parse those instructions and build a functional pytorch network structure (the phenotype);
3. Defining a string-based representation for the optimiser;
4. Defining a way to parse those instructions and build and functional pytorch optimiser;
5. Sample all parameter values from a grammar;
6. Define four simple genetic operators:
   * Network crossover;
   * Add layer mutation;
   * Remove layer mutation;
   * Change optimiser mutation.
